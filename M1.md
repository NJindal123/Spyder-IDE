### Business Goals
#### Financial
Spyder is seeking an initial contribution goal of $7,000 USD in order to fund  baseline development activities which include finishing Spyder 4 and hiring a part-time junior developer [7].

Spyder is seeking a long term sponsorship goal of $35,000 USD per year in order to match the previous funding of Anaconda and take on four part-time developers [7].

Spyder developers continue to seek support from the community to reach the level of funding by releasing new donation tiers and rewards in order to make the release of new features for Spyder 4 possible [7].

#### Managing the quality and reputation of products
For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires that the project continue to be starred and forked by the Github community, thereby increasing potential sponsorship and contributor numbers, directly affecting the quality of the product. In addition, the Spyder contributor community desires to provide the best Scientific Python Development Environment possible [8].

For the Spyder IDE project, the Spyder contributor community desires a maintained and possibly increased rate of commits, bug fixes, pace of development, and new features. This goal can be measured by comparing levels of future commits to the average based on the numbers between November 2017 through May 2018 [9].

#### Meeting personal objectives and Meeting responsibility to society
For the Spyder IDE project, some of the contributors desire to gain new experience, learn new technologies, and enhance their Github portfolio by contributing to the Spyder project. This is an implicit goal based on a general understanding of the motivations of persons who contribute to open source projects. In that regard, such contributors likely desire to create a safe, convenient, and user friendly development environment for Python developers.

### Privacy and Ethics Concerns
##### Introduction

There are numerous considerations to make when conducting a privacy and ethics analysis of a software project. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) provides an excellent Code of Ethics, lending itself to guide such an analysis, and steering a software development project in the right direction. While reading over the documentation, wiki, and the project website for the Spyder Python IDE (Spyder), it was discovered that a specific policy or code of ethics of their own was not present. It was left to the authors of this document to make conclusions based on a combination of references to the ACM and the existing documentation and code for Spyder. However, there are many boilerplate [2] licenses within the Spyder Github repository. This indicates that the developer group is concerned, at least in part, with legal use and distribution of their software. In addition, extensive copyright agreements exist within the repository within 3rd party libraries and frameworks, as well as Spyder proprietary software.

##### Potential Privacy and Security Concerns
Within the Spyder Github code, there is a partially boilerplate MIT style license which permits commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use of their product. Moreover, this license absolves Spyder Project Contributors, at least in part, of any liability under the categories claim, damages, or “other.” This is not, of course, a direct indication that the Spyder Project Contributors themselves are purposely making their software available for malicious or negligent use. However, we still must consider that the developers of the project do not hold themselves liable for any use of the product. Such a consideration is relevant given that Spyder could possibly be used for either a safety or infrastructure related purpose. Of course, these are only speculative considerations for the purposes of this assignment.

Given the open source nature of this project, we must consider that any software utilized on the internet carries with it an inherent danger surrounding privacy issues. Consider one simple example where Notepad++ was “hijacked” by a United States government agency to have access to the content of files written on Notepad++ [11]. Since this project is open source, then it’s mechanics are even more subject to potential analysis and subsequent exploitation by outside parties. Another such example occurred during malicious use of the Dolphin video game emulator [5, 6], allowing arbitrary code execution through disc images; it is clear that open source code is not always just viewed or referenced, but used to design nefarious exploits.

##### Ethical Dilemmas
It is not immediately obvious that Spyder Project Contributors are subject to any kind of explicit agreement to guide project contributions. There is an open invitation to anybody who wants to contribute the project, but neither contribution nor ethical guidelines could not be located [1]. Granted, any code that is submitted is done so via pull request, so the primary contributors and administrators of the Spyder code base presumably will check for malicious or poorly written code. The dilemma here is that anybody who makes a contribution to the Spyder code base is under no apparent set of guiding principles, or, under the kind of scrutiny that somebody in a private sector development job might be under. In addition, an open source contributor has lower stakes on which to base their reputation and livelihood on considering that contributions are done anonymously absent a threat of being fired or ostracised.

An ethical dilemma could arise if a 3rd party company makes significant monetary gains following use of the Spyder product either through direct use of the product, or by a redistribution and possible rebranding. Considering that there exists an extensive use and licensing document present on the Spyder project Github site [2], these rules appear to be for both end users of Spyder, and for developers of Spyder who contribute to the project. Clearly, failure to abide by these rules could result in some legal action based on an oversight of ethical software development and/or business practices.

One particular point in the ACM mentions fair treatment of groups or individuals regardless of their race, community, gender, or general orientation. Any large-scale open source project is certainly subject to public scrutiny with regards to ethical consideration surrounding such unfair treatment. A negative outcry or investigation based on such conflicts of interest might affect the business goals of Spyder [4].

##### Summary
Regarding the ACM General Ethical Principles (in particular to avoid harm, to be fair, taking action not to discriminate, respecting privacy, respecting the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts), initial perusal of the documentation and issues forums seems to indicate that Spyder IDE community adheres to these principles [3,10].

Regarding section 3.7 of the ACM (to recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society), considering that applications written in Spyder utilize the underlying architecture and design decisions of the Spyder IDE global contributors, we believe that the overall quality of code of the project must be strongly considered in order to determine whether this guideline is adhered to or not. This may or may not be ascertained following more extensive documentation of this project later on in the course. At this early stage, however, an in depth product quality analysis based on understanding Spyder architecture is not immediately obvious, and may be weighed in upon at another time.
